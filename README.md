# selftest

## A C++ unit testing library in a single header file

To use it, place the file [selftest.hpp](selftest.hpp) onto your project 
include path.

Then follow the instructions within the file itself.

You might also like to look at the [demo](test/demo.cpp) for an example.

This project also contains a unit test ["testception"](test/testception.cpp)
and a basic Makefile for running the tests and demo program in *nix 
environments.
